class VolumeAugmentation():
    """ The Volume Augmentation class performs diverse augmentation methods on given
        numpy array. The class acts as an easy to use function/interface for applying
        all types of augmentations with just one function call.

    The class can be configured beforehand by selecting desired augmentation techniques
    and method ranges or strength.
    Afterwards, the class is passed to the [DataGenerator][aucmedi.data_processing.data_generator.DataGenerator]
    which utilizes it during batch generation.

    The specific configurations of selected methods can be adjusted by class variables.
