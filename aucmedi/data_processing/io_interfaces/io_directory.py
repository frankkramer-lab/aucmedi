def directory_loader(path_imagedir, allowed_image_formats, training=True):
    """ Data Input Interface for loading a dataset in a directory-based structure.

    This **internal** function allows simple parsing of class annotations encoded in subdirectories.

    ???+ info "Input Formats"
        ```
        Format Directory - Training:
            - Class annotations are encoded via subdirectories
            - Images are provided in subdirectories

        Format Directory - Testing:
            - All images are provided in the directory
            - No class annotations
        ```

    **Expected structure for training:**
    ```
    images_dir/                     # path_imagedir = "dataset/images_dir"
        class_A/
            sample001.png
            sample002.png
            ...
            sample050.png
        class_B/                    # Directory / class names can be any String

        training (bool):                        Boolean option whether annotation data is available.

    Returns:
        index_list (list of str):               List of sample/index encoded as Strings. Required in DataGenerator as

        class_ohe (numpy.ndarray):              Classification list as One-Hot encoding. Required in DataGenerator as
                                                `labels`.
        class_n (int):                          Number of classes. Required in NeuralNetwork for Architecture design as
                                                `n_labels`.
        class_names (list of str):              List of names for corresponding classes. Used for later prediction
                                                storage or evaluation.
        image_format (str):                     Image format to add at the end of the sample index for image loading.
                                                Required in DataGenerator.
