""" State-of-the-art and high-performance medical image classification pipelines
    are heavily utilizing Ensemble Learning strategies.

The idea of Ensemble Learning is to assemble diverse models or multiple predictions and thus
boost prediction performance.

AUCMEDI currently supports the following Ensemble Learning techniques:

| Technique                                  | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Augmenting][aucmedi.ensemble.augmenting]  | Inference Augmenting (test-time augmentation) function for augmenting unknown images for prediction.     |
| [Bagging][aucmedi.ensemble.bagging]        | Cross-Validation based Bagging for equal models trained with different sampling.                         |
| [Stacking][aucmedi.ensemble.stacking]      | Ensemble of unequal models with a fitted Metalearner stacked on top of it.                               |
| [Composite][aucmedi.ensemble.composite]    | Combination of Stacking and Bagging via cross-validation with a fitted Metalearner stacked on top of it. |
