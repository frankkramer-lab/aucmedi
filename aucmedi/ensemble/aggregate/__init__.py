""" Library of implemented Aggregate functions in AUCMEDI.

An Aggregate function can be passed to an ensemble and merges multiple class predictions
into a single prediction.

```
Assembled predictions encoded in a NumPy matrix with shape (N_models, N_classes).
Example: [[0.5, 0.4, 0.1],
          [0.4, 0.3, 0.3],
          [0.5, 0.2, 0.3]]
-> shape (3, 3)

Merged prediction encoded in a NumPy matrix with shape (1, N_classes).
Example: [[0.4, 0.3, 0.3]]
-> shape (1, 3)
```

???+ example "Example"
    ```python
    # Recommended: Apply an Ensemble like Augmenting (test-time augmentation) with Majority Vote
    preds = predict_augmenting(model, test_datagen, n_cycles=5, aggregate="majority_vote")

    # Manual: Apply an Ensemble like Augmenting (test-time augmentation) with Majority Vote
    from aucmedi.ensemble.aggregate import MajorityVote
    my_agg = MajorityVote()
    preds = predict_augmenting(model, test_datagen, n_cycles=5, aggregate=my_agg)
    ```

Aggregate functions are based on the abstract base class
[Aggregate_Base][aucmedi.ensemble.aggregate.agg_base.Aggregate_Base],
which allows simple integration of custom aggregate methods for Ensemble.
