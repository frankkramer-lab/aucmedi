""" Library of evaluation functions in the AUCMEDI environment.

The idea of the evaluation function library is to provide quick and simple functionality
for inspecting and analyzing data as well as results generated by AUCMEDI.

AUCMEDI currently supports the following evaluation techniques:

| Evaluation Technique                                     | Description                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Dataset Analysis][aucmedi.evaluation.dataset]           | Peak into the loaded medical imaging dataset.                                         |
| [Fitting Evaluation][aucmedi.evaluation.fitting]         | Evaluate the fitting curve of a model training process.                               |
| [Performance Evaluation][aucmedi.evaluation.performance] | Evaluate the performance of a single model / prediction list through various metrics. |
| [Performance Comparison][aucmedi.evaluation.comparison]  | Compare the performance of predictions from multiple models.                          |
