    """ Simple wrapper function for calling k-fold cross-validation sampling functions.

    Allow usage of stratified and iterative sampling algorithm.

    ???+ warning
        Be aware that multi-label data does not support random stratified sampling.

    ???+ example
        The sampling is returned as list with length n_splits containing tuples with sampled data.

        ```python title="Example for n_splits=3"
        cv = sampling_kfold(samples, labels, n_splits=3)

        # sampling in which x = samples and y = labels
        # cv <-> [(train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y),   # fold 1
        #         (train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y),   # fold 2
        #         (train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y)]   # fold 3

        # Recommended access on the folds
        for fold in cv:
            (train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y) = fold
        ```

        ```python title="Example with metadata"
        cv = sampling_kfold(samples, labels, metadata, n_splits=2)

        # sampling in which x = samples, y = labels and m = metadata
        # cv <-> [(train_x, train_y, train_m, test_x, test_y, test_m),      # fold 1
        #         (train_x, train_y, train_m, test_x, test_y, test_m)]      # fold 2
        ```

    Args:
        samples (list of str):      List of sample/index encoded as Strings.
        labels (numpy.ndarray):     NumPy matrix containing the ohe encoded classification.
        metadata (numpy.ndarray):   NumPy matrix with additional metadata. Have to be shape (n_samples, meta_variables).
        n_splits (int):             Number of folds (k). Must be at least 2.
        stratified (bool):          Option whether to use stratified sampling based on provided labels.
        iterative (bool):           Option whether to use iterative sampling algorithm.
        seed (int):                 Seed to ensure reproducibility for random functions.

    Returns:
        sampling (list of tuple):   List with length `n_splits` containing tuples with sampled data.
